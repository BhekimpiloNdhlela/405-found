# TODO:

**One has to tick a section as done after finishing the implementation, and after testing the functionality.**

- [ ] Make the **run.py** script specific for handling the running of the application. Move  
nessary code (views) in the run.py script to **views.py** and also move the necessary code in the 
**views.py** to **utils.py**

- [ ] create a config.cnfg (i think, I am not sure about the extension or if it matters) for storing API_KEYs and hashes accossiated to the application.
- [x] Create Project Repository for Version	control.
- [x] Create Trello board for issue management or Project	Management [follw this link to the Trello board](https://trello.com/b/EU293DyA/bootleg-twitter)

- [ ] Profile	page where you can add your photo, write a short bio about yourself that people
following	you, or who would like to follow you, can see, and where you can change	your password.
- [ ] Be able to suggest people to follow. This must be a list of people followed	by those you are
following and that	you	are	not	already	following, ordered based on total number of likes they have 
received on tweets, and secondly on total number of tweets.
- [ ] Be able to tweet, retweet and like a tweet. Also, be able to add a hashtag to a tweet.
- [ ] Tabs that can be selected to see all your tweets, with number of retweets (by username of
person that did the retweet) and likes indicated, ordered from most recent to oldest, a list of people
you	are	following, and a list of people who are following you.
- [ ] Be able to select a particular hashtag, and see tweets with this hashtag (ordered by time), selected from
a	list of 5 most popular hashtags, based on likes and secondly total number of tweets with this hashtag,
from users you are following.
- [ ] A	hashtag	automatically	becomes	a	clickable	link when you tweet it. Anyone who sees the hashtag can click on 
it and be brought to a page featuring the feed of all the	most recent tweets that contain that particular hashtag.
- [ ] Be able to view tweets of people you are following, ordered by time of tweet and likes that a tweet received.
- [ ] Add a tab that can be used to see a	**D3.js** visualization	of the network of users, with follow relationships
indicated, and each user also labelled by username and total number of likes of tweets. [See	for	example](https://medium.com/statuscode/rethinking-twitters-who-to-follow-using-node-jsand-d3-js-d8875d112bc8)
